# timtwiest.nl

This is the source code for my personal website, timtwiest.nl, made with just HTML and CSS for simplicity and easy
upkeep. I've kept it straightforward to avoid the complexities of JavaScript frameworks. However, as the site grows, I
might add more complex features and even use frameworks like Next.js, React, Remix.JS etc.
